cwalk

A program to walk through c code, one function definition at a time

Usage:

$ cwalk -p path/to/project/folder -f function_name

All parameters are optional. 

Displays all definitions of specified function (default is main) in specified folder (default is .). You then get a prompt (cwalk >) where you may enter:

- a folder path, which then searches in the new folder for the current function
- a function name, which then searches in the current folder for the new function
- a file name (under the current folder), to find all definitions of current function in a file of that name under current folder
- a file name followed by line number (foo.c:12) to find the current function at that file:line in current folder
- a line number to display the current function at that line number in all current files
- the letter q to quit the application

Potential features:

- support other languages beyond C
- add history support - to go back and forward between commands
- add autocomplete to complete commands automatically
